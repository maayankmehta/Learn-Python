#datatype assignment operator & Value Error

apples = 10
#the variable age is automatically set to an integer datatype
#print("I have " +apples+ " apples in my bag.")
#this generates an error as apples variable should be a string and not integer
#convert datatype from integer to string as follows

print("I have " +str(apples)+ " apples in my bag.")

#other convertions are also possible like int(apples) & float(apples)
